# timecalc-bootstrap
I recently started learning about bootstrap and jQuery, and thought I'd experiment with it using the time calculator that I previously made

The website allows users to choose a "from" and "to" date/time using HTML input. 
The amount of time between these two dates is then calculated using Javascript.
The format of the result is in days, hours, minutes.
