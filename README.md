# timecalc-bootstrap
I recently started learning about bootstrap and jQuery, and thought I'd experiment with it using the time calculator that I previously made.

Description from other project (which does the same thing)
The website allows users to choose a "from" and "to" date/time using HTML input. 
The amount of time between these two dates is then calculated using Javascript.
The format of the result is in days, hours, minutes. 


## Questions/thoughts ##
A lot of bad coding habits/practices in the code right now, such as no comments and one very long function. Also noticed that the spacing of each line changed after I uploaded the files. I'll work on changing these in future commits.
